  Welcome to my website. I am testing out the Grid AI. So far, the jury is still
  out. I suppose that I could be a bit of a control freak and so not having fine
  grain control over how things look or are laid out is outside of my comfort
  zone. One thing that I really don’t like is that the pages seem to be
  generated each time you view them, so there’s a little pop as the stylesheet
  is applied. This results in the text looking weird and then not.
